<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

In this project, a simple profile page with a `MongoDB` database is used to understand the principles of `Gitops` with `Argo CD`. The webapp is dockerized, deployed  to a `Minikube` Kubernetes cluster using `Argo CD`, and its release process is managed with `Argo Rollouts`. A `Canary` release strategy is implemented using a new docker image of the webapp and its results are show in the following sections. Further, the `Kubernetes` Config files are stored in a different github repo for easing the complexity of the CD pipeline and it is a good practice according to the `Argo CD` docs.  
 So, this project consists of three main tasks: setup and configuration, creating the GitOps pipeline and finally implementing a Canary release.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
### Prerequisites and Installation

 The below points describe the key installations that is needed to run this project:
* The installation of `Kubernetes` or 'kubectl and `Docker` can be followed from their official websites links given in the above section. 
* For installing the `Minikube` cluster on my local machine, I have followed the steps from the [official documentation](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/). In this project, I have used the cluster as a container, so the driver I am using to start the cluster is `Docker`.
* Next in the `Minikube`cluster, Argo CD is installed following the [official documentation](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/). 
* Since one of the aims of this project is to include a canary release strategy, Argo Rollouts is also installed in the cluster following the [official documentation](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/blob/master/docs/installation.md#kubectl-plugin-installation). I have also installed the Kubectl plugin, so that it is possible to visualiza and manage the plugins from the command line.
In the section, the steps involved to create this project is defined.
<!-- * npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/DOOMNOVA/A_p_test.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Enter your API in `config.js`
   ```js
   const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
   ``` -->
## Steps Involved - Without Argo Rollouts
* The initial step involves pushing a docker container image of the web application to `DockerHub`. So, the docker files - `Dockerfile` and`docker-compose.yaml` is created. Further, in order to streamline the process a github action workflow file - `main.yaml` is created to push a new image to `DockerHub` everytime there is change to the source code repo.

* Next in the `Minikube` cluster I have initially created, a new namespace `myapp` is created for the webapplication and the config files will be run inside this. The Kubernetics manifest files in the  [Config repo](https://github.com/DOOMNOVA/A_P_config_argocd.git) uses the image - `doomnova/webapp-argocd:latest` , which was  prevoiusly pushed to the `Dockerhub` . This image will be the know as the initial  web app container image in this project.
* Since I am using a `MongoDB` database for the webapp, the Config files in the [repo](https://github.com/DOOMNOVA/A_P_config_argocd.git)- `mongo.yaml`, `mongo-secret.yaml` and `mongo-config.yaml` are used to define database in the cluster.  The `webappdeployment.yaml` is used to deploy the login page app developed in this project. For the  web application, there are two `replicas:2` defined in this project. Further, inorder to access the app in the browser, the `NodePort` service is defined in the  `webappdeployment.yaml`. Note that inorder to use the file for this task, uncomment  code for the kubernetes resource type `Deployment` and comment the kubernetes resource type `Rollout` in the latest `webappdeployment.yaml`file in the Config repo.
* Finally, the `application.yaml` is used to defined the entire application in the `Minikube` cluster. In this file, we can specify the Config file repo that should be watched  by `Argo CD` to makes change to the application in the cluster.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Results - Without Argo Rollouts
Now to deploy the web application using the initial image, the below code can run in the terminal:
 ```sh
  kubectl -f apply application.yaml
  ```
we can see the webapp deployment

## Steps Involved - With Argo Rollouts
In this section, we will look at the steps taken to change the current web application to include a canary release rollout strategy using Argo CD Rollouts.
